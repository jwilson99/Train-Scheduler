# On page load, existing train data will populate in the page table under "Current Train Schedule".

# Input a train name, destination, time of first arrival, and frequency of arrival to update the page.

# The pages updates a table to include the train name, destination, and frequency. It also calculates the time of the next train arrival and the minutes until that arrival.
